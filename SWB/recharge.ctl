# In order to conserve disk space, real values are converted to
# integer values, and the resulting data stream is compressed using
# a simple run-length encoding (RLE) scheme. A larger value for the
# RLE multiplier preserves more of the real data value and lowers the
# amount of data compression that takes place. However, a value for
# the RLE_MULTIPLIER that is too large may result in an INTEGER OVERFLOW
# error, in which the converted data value exceeds the storage capacity
# for the integer data structure. In this case, the RLE_MULTIPLIER
# must be lowered in order that the maximum integer value to be stored
# stays within the limitations of the data type. For a 4-byte integer,
# the converted real value must stay inside the range from
# -2,147,483,647 and +2,147,483,647. A real value of 22,000, with a
# RLE_MULTIPLIER value of 100,000 will result in an INTEGER OVERFLOW

# SOLUTION METHOD
#
# Two solution methods are available for the routing of surface water
# through the model domain. The "ITERATIVE" method closely resembles
# Wes Dripps' original solution method, wherein water is iteratively moved
# across the entire grid until all water has either infiltrated or
# left the grid via surface flow.
#
# The "DOWNHILL" method was developed by Vic Kelson, and involves
# a pre-simulation step whereby the model grid cells are sorted in an
# upstream to downstream fashion.  Thereafter, runoff is calculated once
# for the entire model domain, proceeding from the upstream cells to the
# downstream cells. The DOWNHILL option is preferred.
#
#RUNOFF C-N ITERATIVE
RUNOFF C-N DOWNHILL
#RUNOFF C-N NO_ROUTING
#*******************************************************************

# ITERATIVE METHOD TOLERANCE
#
# The iterative method sometimes fails to converge for exceedingly
# small solution tolerances (i.e. < 1E-6 change in calculated
# runoff in a cell from one iteration to the next).  This option is
# offered as a way to force convergence.  The default value is 1E-12.

#ITERATIVE_METHOD_TOLERANCE 1.0E-4

# EVAPOTRANSPIRATION METHOD

# The model implements several different methods for estimating ET,
# including:
# 1) Thornthwaite-Mather (program option: "T-M" latitude  )
# 2) Jensen-Haise (program option: "J-H" latitude albedo a_s b_s )
# 3) Blaney-Criddle (program option: "B-C" latitude )
