        "-\tImages. This folder will contain the output. The folder contains 3 subfolders for the outputs: annual, monthly, and daily.\n",
        "-\tInput. This folder contains the input gridded data (except those related to climate data): available water capacity (AWC.asc generated with AWC.ipynb), flow direction (flow_direction.asc generated with Flow_direction.ipynb), hydrologic soil group (Hydrologic_Group_B.asc or Hydrologic_Group_R.asc which can be generated with the hydrologic_group.ipynb code), and land cover information (LC.asc)\n",

        "-\tChange the directory: set to the folder containing SWB.exe and all the other files and folders as previously described. This operation is because the file display.txt containing the output must be generated in the same folder of the Main.ipynb code. \n",
        "-\tRun SWB typing the following string: powershell \"swb recharge.ctl | tee display.txt\" (if using anaconda PowerShell prompt do not write PowerShell). It will run swb controlled by recharge.ctl and the terminal display is instantaneously saved in a txt file (display.txt).\n",

In this case is necessary to modify the first value of the grid that make the code raising the error. This modification is doable using notepad (or notepad++) opening the file and substituting the first value of the grid with its equivalent integer number (e.g., 1.0 with 1). This may be due to a bug in the libraries used to generate the inputs.\n",
